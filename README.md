# Log Checker
This is a simeple log checker script written in Powershell 2. If the the path contained many folders (hundreds or thousands of folders each containing log file) then this can be used to find a desired text in the log file. The result is then saved in csv file with the file name and directory. Feel free to use and improve this.
