## Log Checker
This is a simple log checker script written in Powershell 2.

## Motivation
I was in need of search some files with specefic strings in a folder (containing thousands of subfolders and files). Manually it took a long time. To automate the process I have created this `PowerShell` script.

## Features
If the the path contained many folders (hundreds or thousands of folders each containing log file) then this can be used to find a desired text in the log file. The result is then saved in csv file with file name and directory. Feel free to use and improve this.
